## Developer notes

The development of Melissa's portfolio was deeply influenced by the intrinsic symbolism of tarot cards and the distinctive aesthetic of the Monster High franchise. In technical implementation, these inspirations translate into specific design and interactivity choices.

The presence of tarological elements is evident in the selection of images and symbolism, reflected in the visual compositions of the works. The technical approach included the deliberate incorporation of archetypal images, symbolic typography and meaningful color palettes to convey visual narratives in line with the rich tarot tradition.

Monster High's bold and unconventional aesthetic plays a vital role in the portfolio's design. Monster High-inspired graphic elements and color choices have been integrated, reflecting the franchise's boldness and individuality. This has translated into dynamic layouts, custom icons, and an overall atmosphere that evokes the vibrant spirit of Monster High.
